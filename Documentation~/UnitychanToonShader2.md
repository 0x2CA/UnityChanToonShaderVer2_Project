# About &lt;Unitychan ToonShader2&gt;
**Unitychan ToonShader 2.0.7.5 (UTS2)** is a toon shader for images and video that is designed to meet the needs of creators working on cel-shaded 3DCG animations. Unlike other pre-render toon shaders, all features can be adjusted in real time on Unity, which is the greatest feature of UTS2.  

UTS2 has great power and makes a wide variety of character designs possible, from cel-shaded to light novel illustration styles.  

For more information, see [README.md](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/UnityChanToonShaderVer2_Project/blob/master/README.md).

# Technical details
## Requirements
* **Requires Unity 5.6.x or higher**. The operation check from latest Unity 2019.3.x to Unity 2017.4.x LTS has been completed.  
* UTS2 uses **a forward rendering environment**. Using **a linear color space** is recommended. (A gamma color space can also be used, but this tends to strengthen shadow gradiation. For more details, see [Linear or Gamma Workflow](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LinearRendering-LinearOrGammaWorkflow.html).)
* Target Platforms are **Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, PlayStation4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch**. Tessellation version is only supported for environments where DX11/DX12 works properly.  
* This Package Manager version is equivalent to UTS2 v.2.0.7.5 in the Original Github repository.  


## Known limitations

* UTS2 runs under legacy rendering pipeline.
